# Segmentation Customer with RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) Analysis - Ralali Study Case

As a Data Analytics for Business student in Bitlabs Academy, one of our final projects is to solve a business case given by Bitlabs' business partners, including Ralali.

Ralali wants to enlarge its business by developing its marketing strategies. There are several analysis techniques that can be used to determine customer segmentation effectively, one of them is RFM analysis.

This documentation shows the flow of projects, from data cleaning, data analysis, and eventually visualization.
The data used for this project is confidential, hence I only provide the code, visualizations, and insights!
